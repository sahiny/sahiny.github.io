*The Role of Information Aggregators in Tax Compliance -Job Market Paper

	* In 2011 only, 56% of U.S. individual tax returns were submitted with the help of a paid preparer. One of the many roles tax preparation firms serve is offering strategic advice based on the taxpayer information they have amassed. This paper formalizes this role, using a simple asymmetric information model where agents can purchase information about government's enforcement rules by hiring a tax preparer firm. In a perfectly competitive market for the preparation services, demand for tax preparers is selective and in most cases increases in taxpayer income. Moreover, the presence of tax preparers always decreases compliance. The government can counter this effect by revealing information about its enforcement tools under certain conditions. Finally, reduced competition in the preparer market has the potential to increase tax compliance levels.

Tax Evasion under Lying Aversion
Empirical findings in public finance literature suggest that people might not be evading as much as standard theory suggests. One intuitive explanation for this is that people incur a psychological cost when they lie. In order to analyze tax evasion decisions, I extend the combined lying cost model to an evasion context where the first dimension is an individual's "type" that determines her primitive preference for lying and is specific to this individual and the second dimension captures the societal attitude towards dishonesty, specifically, disutility derived due to deviations from the norm. I also endogenize the enforcement decisions of the tax authority to incorporate both the fraction of liars and the attitude towards lying in a society.
