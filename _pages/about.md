I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I work in Prof. Necmiye Ozay's group. In 2018, I worked with Prof. Stavros Tripakis at Aalto University, Finland.

My main research interest is to improve the capabilities of cyber-physical systems with particular focus on multi-robot coordination and autonomous driving. As a graduate student, I develop methods and algorithms that combine ideas and tools from control theory, formal methods and optimization.

I am currently looking for job opportunities.
